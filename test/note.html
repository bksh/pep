    <h1>Pep test - Note</h1>
    <p>
      Creating a note is quite simple:
    </p>
    <div class="convention">
<!-- CONVENTION:STARTS-->
<a href="#note" data-pep-note>Click to read the footnote</a>
<aside id="note">This is the footnote.</aside>
<!-- CONVENTION:ENDS -->
    </div>
    <p>
      Here's an example of a longer footnote. Notice that the text of the
      link is used as the title of the note itself.
    </p>
    <div class="convention">
<!-- CONVENTION:STARTS-->
<a href="#dfw" data-pep-note>David Foster Wallace says&hellip;</a>
<aside id="dfw">
<p>
  Sorry about this phrase: I hate this phrase, too. This happens to be one of
  those very rare times when "historical context" is the phrase to use and
  there is no equivalent phrase that isn't even worse. (I actually tried
  "lexico-temporal backdrop" in one of the middle drafts, which I think you'll
  agree is not preferable.)
</p>

<p><strong><center>
  INTERPOLATION
</center></strong></p>

<p>
  The above &para; is motivated by the fact that this reviewer almost always
  sneers and/or winces when he sees "historical context" deployed in a piece
  of writing and thus hopes to head off any potential sneers/winces from the
    reader here, especially in an article about felicitous usage.
</p>
</aside>
<!-- CONVENTION:ENDS -->
    </div>

    <p>
      Perhaps the most awesome thing about Pep notes is that you can
      style them. Use the <code>data-pep-note-stylesheet</code> attribute
      to point at a local stylesheet, like this:
    </p>

    <div class="convention">
<!-- CONVENTION:STARTS-->
<a
  href="#black-note"
  data-pep-note
  data-pep-note-stylesheet="resources/note-black.css"
>(pssst!)</a>
<aside id="black-note">
  <p>A reference to the Rolling Stones:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I see a red door and I want to paint it black.</p>
  </blockquote>
</aside>
<!-- CONVENTION:ENDS -->
    </div>

    <p>
      Notice in the above example that the title of the note has been
      hidden. When you use a <code>data-pep-note-stylesheet</code> you can
      style the <code>note-title</code> class however you like, including
      setting it to <code>display: none</code> as here.
